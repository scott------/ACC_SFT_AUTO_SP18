<CourseInfo>
Course information:
Description: Automated Web Testers do the methodical, patient yet collaborative work of ensuring that revisions and updates to websites and web apps are error-free.

The websites and web apps we use are becoming more complex and dynamic; testing the quality of content and code manually has therefore also become very time intensive. Using Selenium and WebDriver, a testing process that would require two weeks of manual checking can be done in minutes. Automated testing is therefore a needed skill for the many website development, web app development and software development companies in our region.  In addition, the skills and habits practiced in the course are part of the foundation for a  career in cyber security.
